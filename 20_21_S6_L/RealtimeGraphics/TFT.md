## Haptic rendering

The computational model which allows the creation of reaction forces between the virtual tool being manipulated by the user and the physics-based object. Such computed reaction forces are then send back to the **haptic** device for creation of sense of touch at the hand of the user. In case of virtual deformable object, such reaction forces on the object may also cause the object to deform or tear apart.



## Programmable pipeline

A development process in realtime graphics consisting of multiple stages where each stage contributes to a final result by specific *preprogramed* action.



## OpenGL

*Open graphic library.* One possible API for communication with the GPU. (since GPU is used for computations in the realtime graphics  an API for direct communication is necessary)



## Vulkan

Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.



## Direct3D 12 (D3D12)

Direct3D 12 provides an API and platform that allows apps to take advantage of the graphics and computing capabilities of PCs equipped with one or more Direct3D 12-compatible GPUs.



## Geometric primitive

The term geometric primitive, or prim, in vector computer graphics, CAD [*] systems, and Vector Geographic information systems is the simplest (i.e. 'atomic' or irreducible) geometric shape that the system can handle (draw, store). Sometimes the subroutines that draw the corresponding objects are called "geometric primitives" as well. The most "primitive" primitives are point and straight line segment, which were all that early vector graphics systems had.

In constructive solid geometry, primitives are simple geometric shapes such as a cube, cylinder, sphere, cone, pyramid, torus.

## Framebuffer

A framebuffer (frame buffer, or sometimes framestore) is a portion of random-access memory  containing a bitmap that drives a video display. It is a memory buffer containing data representing all the pixels in a complete video frame. Modern video cards contain framebuffer circuitry in their cores. This circuitry converts an in-memory bitmap into a video signal that can be displayed on a computer monitor.

The information in the buffer typically consists of colour values for every pixel to be shown on the display. Colour values are commonly stored in 1-bit binary (monochrome), 4-bit palettized, 8-bit palettized, 16-bit high colour and 24-bit true colour formats. An additional alpha channel is sometimes used to retain information about pixel transparency. The total amount of memory required for the framebuffer depends on the resolution of the output signal, and on the colour depth or palette size.



## Interpolation

In the context of live-action and computer animation, interpolation is inbetweening, or filling in frames between the key frames. It typically calculates the in-between frames through use of (usually) piecewise polynomial interpolation to draw images semi-automatically.

For all applications of this type, a set of "key points" is defined by the graphic artist. These are values that are rather widely separated in space or time, and represent the desired result, but only in very coarse steps. The computed interpolation process is then used to insert many new values in between these key points to give a "smoother" result.
